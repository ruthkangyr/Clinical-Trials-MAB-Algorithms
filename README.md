In this project, we focus on performing acute ischemic stroke trials using MAB solutions. We aim to investigate the following: 
* Which treatment method is the best for treating acute ischemic stroke?
* As compared to Randomised Treatment Assignments, are MAB algorithms more effective in giving a higher cumulative reward for the best treatment method?
* Is there a statistical difference in performance between different age groups and different sex for each treatment method?
* Which is the ideal MAB algorithm which gives the highest cumulative reward?
* Is there a statistical difference in performance between the different MAB algorithms?

The findings of these experiments can be used to test on other clinical trials as well.

### Folder Information:
**1. Algorithm**
* In this folder, we peform MAB algorithm tuning (including contextual bandits) and Bootstrap Evaluation Replay for the different MAB algorithms.

**2. Data Cleaning**
* In this folder, we perform data preprocessing and extracting off the necessary columns used for our MAB algorithms.
